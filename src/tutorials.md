# Haddock3 tutorial

Haddock3 is not only a tool, but also a set of training materials, allowing new user to understand the main aspects and functionalities available in haddock3.

The list of tutorials is available from our [BonvinLab website -> education -> haddock3 -> tutorials](https://www.bonvinlab.org/education/HADDOCK3/)

We have now also added a Jupyter notebooks directory to the source code. Those can be directly started on Google Colab or on your own resource. Visit the [haddock3 repository](https://github.com/haddocking/haddock3/tree/main/notebooks) for instructions.

Please note that we are constantly adding new tutorials, and therefore new ones may appear from time to time.


## Haddock2.X tutorial

Together with the development of haddock3, we are trying to update and port previously written tutorials made for the haddock2.X series to haddock3.
If a specific tutorial is not available for haddock3, you can always refere to [the haddock2.x tutorials](https://www.bonvinlab.org/education/HADDOCK24/) to obtain input files and understand what are the key points required for a sucessful docking.
